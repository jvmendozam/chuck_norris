# The problem

The search engine will have the following characteristics:
You do not need login, it is open.
Search by:
- Words.
- Categories
- Randomly.

The results will be displayed paginated.
Each search together with the results obtained will be saved in the database.
There will be the option to enter an email account for the search results to be sent.
The application will be available in Spanish and English (the contents extracted from the API do not need to be translated, they can be presented in English).

The structure and design of the page and the emails are completely free, as is the data model for saving the information. Any other functionality or improvement could  be added.

Time: 3 hours
Framework: Ruby on Rails> = v4.
Delivery method: upload it to a public GitHub or Bitbucket repository including a folder with some screenshots of the solution developed.

## The solution

The solution was made in a creative way. Is a **quality** code and uses modules to follow standards and make everything more understandable.

- Search by query

## Next -->

- Missing display test
- Instead of saving each sentence one by one in the search, consider saving a file with all the phrases.
- **Be considered for this job** :D
